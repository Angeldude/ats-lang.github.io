<h1>
Effective ATS:<br>
Functional Programming with Combinators
</h1>

##para('\
A great strength in functional programming lies
in its support for a combinator-based style of programming.
In this article, I would like to present some examples
that make extensive use of sequence-processing combinators,
where a sequence may refer to either a list or a stream (that is,
a lazy list) in ATS.
